# AutomatedExamMarker

This project presents the mathematical development of a system to automate the processof reading student grades from exam scripts using computer vision - imaging techniquesand convoluted neural networking. The three biggest challenges in achieving this aresymbol extraction, defining the region of interest to allow for the practice of the scriptcorrector writing the Grade outside the grade box and, accuracy.....Document analysis has a wide range of real world applications such as the processing of bank cheques, improving the performance of document retrieval systems, or processing road signs..

# Objective

Every year the process of correcting examination scripts creates a signifi-cant burden on the academic staff. The responsibility of ensuring that the correct gradesattributed to the student are transcribed from the actual script and uploaded to the ad-ministrative office of the department takes time and effort to ensure accuracy. Dependingon the number of students sitting the exam, the number of questions per module andthe number of modules involved, these administrative tasks demand a considerable timeand economic challenge. By utilising the latest developments in artificial intelligence andmachine learning is it possible to tune the mathematical functions to produce the desiredoutput.
<br />
Intensity and feature based methods for image registration are combined to build a morerobust system for geometric correction. A more robust approach for identifying thegrades box and exam box on exam scripts is developed and implemented. Although these methods vulnerable to occlusion on the exam script, a slightly improved recall of 94% was achieved in locating the grade box on a sequence of exam scripts compared tousing a feature based approach only.

This project addresses methods for the design of an OCR system using a convolutionalneural network to recognise digits 0-25 and symbols Q1 - Q5 on the exam script to serveinitial proof of concept. A dataset of12, 000handwritten symbols is created. Unlikeexisting work, the approach in this project involves training a CNN on the entire symbolas opposed to individual digits. Methods for reducing overfitting are also exploredKeywords:Document Analysis, Optical Character Recognition,Geometric Correction,Region of Interest
